# GCL
G? class library
# Preface
This project started as a hobby, teach myself C#, not to mention very open source.<br>
Actually I'm not good at .net programming, neither english.<br>
Have been living in embedded world about 20 years with data sheet, peripheral, interrupt, etc.<br>
It's time to turn around and find a way to hand over something to my fellow.<br>
Some kind of UML, e.g., package diagram, class diagram, sequence diagram, etc, shall be a good way to that<br>
so I'd like to mention those with iterative work flow on github as possible as I can.<br>
Believe in occam's razor but insight should not have come without enormous experience.<br>
Hopefully this is the first step for that.<br>
